# Cartoleiros Backend
 This repository represents a backend developed for the app "Cartoleiros".

This backend is responsible for the management of app users, register new users, and so on. Basicly, this repository is a CRUD (create, read, update and delete) for the app.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
node
npm 
```
### Configuring Postgres Database

Open up the file database.js on the path src/config and replace where we had "<>" with your values. In this project was used a platform called ElephantSQL, where we can host a postgres database for free. Below there is an example for configure your own postgres database.

</p>

* Replace url for the "URL" contained on ElephantSQL;
* Replace host for the "Server" contained on ElephantSQL;
* Replace username and database for the "User & Default database" contained on ElephantSQL, and finally
* Replace password for "password" contained on ElephantSQL
``` Javascript
module.exports = {
   dialect: 'postgres',
   url: "<YOUR URL HERE>",
   host: '<YOUR HOST HERE>',
   username: '<YOUR USER NAME HERE>',
   password: '<YOUR PASSWORD HERE>',
   database: '<YOUR DATABASE HERE>',
   ssl: true,
   define: {
      timestamps: true,
      underscored: true
   }
}
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

To install node and npm, go to the link below and download the LTS version

``` 
https://nodejs.org/en/download/
```

Clone this repository, open up on your favorite code editor and then run the command line below to install all needed packages to run in your local machine

``` 
npm install
```
After install all needed packages, we need to run the migrations to create the tables, so we run the command line:
```
npx sequelize db:migrate
```
After that, run de command:

```
npm run dev
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
